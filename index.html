					<h2 style="color:white;">About</h2>
					<p style="color:white;"> Visceral Abyss is a Horror Dungeon Looter with roguelike 
						elements. The goal of the game is to explore a random network or felsh caves and
						 rooms in order to find valuables. To traverse the caves the player can purchase
						  Items to light the way, defend against threats, and find treasures. The capital
						   available to the player initially is very little so the player must aquire more
						    items and sell them to be able to purcahse more powerful items and reach deeper
							 depths of the caves.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p style="color:white;">This is a Vertical Slice of a game for a University Course. My name is Atal Kakar and I worked on this as a Solo Developer.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p style="color:white;">My game was designed under the following externally imposed constraints:
						Limited Vision, Limited Dexterity, Limited Audition, Limited Energy and Attention, total transfer data size less the 100mb,
						 and Localized to at least two languages.</p>

				<h2 style="color:white;">Narrative</h2>
				<p style="color:white;"> In the year 1961, A little known mining company Fring’s Group discovered a vast network of living flesh caves. A leviathan beneath Earth. To them It was a new Frontier filled with riches. To others, it was out of man’s jurisdiction and to be avoided. To you in the future, it is an abandoned goldmine.</p>

				<h2 style="color:white;">Technical Details</h2>
				<p style="color:white;">I'm a solo Developer so here are some techniques I used and would like to highlight.
					 My approach has been to experiment with and implement highlevel techniques in order to increase the 
					 depth of the most important aspects within the game. So far I've added Random Dungeon Generation, 
					 Inverse Kinematics, and Intelligent AI steering Behavior.</p>

				<h2 style="color:white;">Goals</h2>
				<p style="color:white;">My goal is to continue working on this project and truly bring it alive. My focus going forward will be on increasing 
					replayability while also improving visual and auditory assets.</p>
				<p style="color:white;">I'm looking for someone to fund the development of Visceral Abyss.</p>
