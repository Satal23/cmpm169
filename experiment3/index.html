			<h1>Experiment X - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I Initially decided to modify the example on <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/M_1_3_02">HERE</a>. After messing around for a while I wanted to create noise in<br>
					 more dimensions so I had to use perlin noise. I took some inspiration from the example found <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/generative-design/sketches/M_1_4_01">HERE</a>.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>I wanted to recreate the look of the second link with perlin noise so I decided to use some cubes. My goal <br>
					was to create a gird full of cubes and use perlin noise to move the cubes up and down over time. After <br>
					tweaking around with some values and creating a cube class, I iterated through the cubes and had them move<br>
					 using a function. The function took a noise value to move the z over time.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>To further Innovate on the moving wavelike motion of the inspiration code, I wanted to make it a bit more interactive. <br>
					So I added mouse position to change the color of the cubes and to offset the current Z of nearby cubes. I was happy with <br>
					the effect it had visually. I wanted to lower the size of the cubes and Increase the count so that it further resembles water<br>
					 however, it comes at a huge performance hit so I set it to optimal settings while keeping the look of moving fluid.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I contributed most of the changes except some inspiration and starting points from other page listed above.</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>I worked on this by myself. I beileve I did a good job and took the time to find good values for performance while keeping visuals intact.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>It was hard to figure you how to mimic the fluid like motion at first until I began to look at it like a grid.</p>
