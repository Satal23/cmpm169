				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>To develop artistic creativity in coding, it can be helpful to start by studying and learning from existing examples. This might involve reviewing code written by others, analyzing successful techniques, or even copying and modifying code to better understand how it works. By imitating and learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can gain a better understanding of what has been done before and what is possible, and identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</p>
				<p>What code did you start with? (You don't need to provide the code itself, but where did you start?) Document this step briefly.</p>
				<p>I started by editing my code from experiement 3 since I wanted to use cubes to visualize audio.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>After learning from existing techniques and strategies, we can build upon that foundation by combining elements from different sources. This might involve combining elements from different programming languages, using libraries or frameworks in new ways, or bringing together techniques from different fields or disciplines. By integrating and combining elements from different sources, we can create something new and unique.</p>
				<p>How did you extend the code or combine with another technique to make something new? Document this step.</p>
				<p>I removed the noise and many cubes and changed the Camera Angle to be front facing flat on. At this point the Cubes were in a straight line moving in a wave like motion <br>
				but they didn't exactly look like a visual representation of audio.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>Finally, we can introduce new or original ideas to our coding process by thinking creatively and pushing the boundaries. This might involve developing entirely new techniques or approaches, or using existing techniques in new and creative ways. By innovating and introducing new ideas, we can create art that is truly groundbreaking.</p>
				<p>How did you use the code as a jumping off point to create something truly unique and novel? Document this step thoroughly.</p>
				<p>To better represent visual audio, instead of moving the cubes up and down randomly, I made it so the size of the cube changes instead. I also introduced some randomness and a <br>
				wave like patten to better represent visual audio.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment. Here's where you can put your reflections.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>What part of the project you contributed</li>
					<p>I contributed All of the the changes by using my code from experiment 3 which has its own inspiration and starting code.</p>
					<li>A reflection on your work and the work of the team</li>
					<p>I worked on this by myself. I believe I represented visual audio well using randomness, cubes, and a wave pattern.</p>
					<li>Brief highs and lows</li>
					<p>After working on experiment 3 where I tried to imitated fluid like motion, it was rather simple to transform that into visual audio.</p>
